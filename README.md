# Me in Markdown 
## Introduction
Hi, my name is Danica Little and I am currently in 10th grade. Some of my hobbies are reading, writing, baking, and drawing. One fact about myself is that I like to solve escape rooms and cold cases. I tend to be an over achiver and thinker resulting in frquent burnout. I strive to mantain or go above my 4.0 gpa. 

Ever since I was little I wanted to become a doctor but was unsure of what kind. In 4th grade, I discovered my love for skin care and learning about the skin. During covid, I was diagnosed with vitiligo, an auto immune disease that affects my skin. Due to my diagnose I did some research, when researching I found it very intresting. However, in recent years, I found my love for forensics. Watching shows like "Dexter," solving escape rooms, and cold cases sufaced this interest. Along with aspirring to becoming a dermatologist I would also love to be a forensic scientist.

A hobby I've had with me ever since I was a little kid is creative writing. Throughout the years I've created many stories and universes with differing generes and plots. Currently, I am working on three stories. With my friend we are co-writing a dystopian world where the goverement has lost all power and a new association takes control for the worst. Independently, I am writing two other stories, one a fantasy with heros and villians, and a murderous psychological thriller. One day, I hope to feel confident enough in my work to submit it to writing contests.
