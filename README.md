## Introduction
Hi, my name is Danica Little and I am currently in 10th grade. Some of my hobbies are reading, writing, baking, and drawing. One fact about myself is that I like to solve escape rooms and cold cases. I tend to be an over achiver and thinker resulting in frquent burnout. I strive to mantain or go above my 4.0 gpa. 

Ever since I was little I wanted to become a doctor but was unsure of what kind. In recent years, I discovered my love for skin care and learning about the skin.
